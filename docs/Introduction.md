#NCDL: Non-Cartesian Deep Learning

---
### Introduction
NCDL is a powerful tool for performing tensor operations and tracking their gradients 
on data that reside on non-Cartesian lattices. Non-Cartesian lattices, such as the hexagonal or BCC/FCC, 
lattices can be particularly useful for representing data with a natural circular structure, such as 
images or scientific simulations. However, traditional tensor operations, which are 
based on the Cartesian coordinate system, can be difficult to apply to non-Cartesian data.

Our library helps to solve this problem by providing a comprehensive set of tools for performing tensor computations on a wide range of non-Cartesian lattices. These tools can be used to build and train machine learning models on non-Cartesian data, allowing you to take advantage of the unique properties and structure of your data. With the Non-Cartesian Tensor Computation Library, you can easily perform common tensor operations, such as contraction, permutation, and slicing, on non-Cartesian data, enabling you to build more powerful and accurate machine learning models.

Whether you are a researcher, engineer, or data scientist, the Non-Cartesian Tensor Computation Library can help you get the most out of your data. We hope you find it useful and we look forward to hearing about the exciting things you will do with it.
