## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue on our [Issues page](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname/issues) with a descriptive title. The issue should include:

- Clear, concise steps to reproduce the problem
- Details of your operating environment (OS, version of NCDL, etc.)
- Any error messages or relevant logs

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature, or a suggestion on how to improve existing functionality, please create a new issue with the following details:

- A clear, concise explanation of the problem your suggestion would solve
- A detailed explanation of your proposed solution
- Any additional context (screenshots, mockups, etc.) if applicable

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `Beginner` and `Help-Wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help-Wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `Beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

- Please branch from the `main` branch and, if needed, rebase to the current `main` before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with `main` you may be asked to rebase your changes.
- Please ensure that your proposed code does not break any tests. Run all the tests locally on your machine before submitting the pull request.
- Provide a detailed description of the changes in the Pull Request.
